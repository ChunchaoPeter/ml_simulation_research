# ML Simulation Research

State estimation and filtering algorithms for linear and non-linear state-space models using TensorFlow.

## Overview

This repository implements and analyzes simulation-based filtering methods for probabilistic state estimation:

- **Kalman Filter (KF)** - Optimal filtering for linear Gaussian state-space models
- **Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)** - Linearization-based filtering for non-linear systems
- **Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF)** - Sigma point transform for non-linear systems
- **Particle Filter (PF)** - Sequential Monte Carlo for general non-linear/non-Gaussian systems
- **Deterministic Kernel Flows** - EDH, LEDH, PFPF, and PFF for high-dimensional state estimation
- **Differentiable Particle Flows** - A reusable OOP-based SMC framework with differentiable resampling via entropy-regularized optimal transport, designed to generalise to new state-space models

The report Particle_Flow___Differentiable_PFs_Report.pdf include:

- Section A. A literature review.
- Section B. From classical filters to particle flows (Part I).
- Section C. Stochastic Particle Flow and Differentiable PF (Part II).

> **Note on `differentiable_particle_flows/`**: Unlike the other subprojects which are standalone implementations, `differentiable_particle_flows` is a proper **object-oriented SMC framework**. The codebase is reorganized into abstract base classes (`ObservationModelBase`, `TransitionModelBase`, `ProposalModelBase`, `ResamplerBase`) and a generic `SMC` orchestrator that composes them via dependency injection. This makes it a **reusable foundation** — to apply the particle filter to a new state-space model (e.g., nonlinear dynamics, non-Gaussian observations, neural network proposals), you only need to implement the relevant abstract interfaces and plug them in. The core filtering logic and all resampling strategies (multinomial, soft, regularised OT) work unchanged. See [`differentiable_particle_flows/README.md`](differentiable_particle_flows/README.md) for the full architecture guide and extension examples.

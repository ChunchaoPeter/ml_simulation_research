# TODO

1. We need to use Black to ensure consistent code formatting.

2. Consider using the Kalman Filter (KF) as the reference (true) values for the integration test, since it gives us expected results. I’m still thinking about whether it’s worth doing that.

3. We probably don’t need a test for lgss_sample.py.
